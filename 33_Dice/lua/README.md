### Porting notes for Lua

- This is a straightfoward port with only minor modifications for input
validation and text formatting.

- The "Try again?" question accepts 'y', 'yes', 'n', 'no' (case insensitive),
whereas the original BASIC version defaults to no unless 'YES' is typed.

- The "How many rolls?" question presents a more user friendly message
in case of invalid input.
